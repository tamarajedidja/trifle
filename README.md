## ðŸªœ Overview

This repository contains:

1. **The TRIFLE module** for running the full pipeline on fMRI data.  
   _Note: This module is under construction. A streamlined CLI version will be released soon._

2. **Scripts used in the TRIFLE paper**  
   These scripts are located in the `triflepaper_scripts/` folder and reproduce all core figures and analyses from the publication.

## ðŸ§  About TRIFLE

**TRIFLE** is a multivariate time-varying functional connectivity method that explicitly accounts for spatial overlap. It extends **Temporal Functional Mode (TFM)** analysis (Smith et al., 2012) to estimate time-varying changes in the linear mixing of spatially and temporally independent sources in fMRI data.

In case you use TRIFLE, please cite the following paper:
