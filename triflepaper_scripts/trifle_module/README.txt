TRIFLE is a multivariate time-varying functional connectivity method that explicitly accounts for spatial overlap. It extends Temporal Functional Mode (TFM) analysis (Smith et al., 2012) to estimate time-varying changes in the linear mixing of spatially and temporally independent sources in fMRI data.

The package only supports python 3.6+.
