TV-TFMS (Time-Varying Temporal Functional Modes) is a multivariate time-varying functional 
connectivity method that explicitely accounts for spatial overlap. It is an extension of 
Temporal Functional Mode analysis by Smith et al. (2012), which retrieves the time-varying 
changes in functional connectivity of temporally independent and spatially overlapping sources.  
The package only supports python 3.6+, and requires the packages numpy, scipy, FILL IN (!!)
